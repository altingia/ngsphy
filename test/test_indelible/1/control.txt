Generating multi-partitioned datasets is achieved by simply adding more [..]
statements to [PARTITIONS] blocks (see below). Each partition may contain
a different [MODEL] or [BRANCHES] block, may have a different length, and may
use a different tree. The only restriction is that random trees cannot be used
in the same partition as [BRANCHES] blocks and the different trees must all
have the same number of taxa (with the same taxa names).
